Creation Date- 12/19/2017

This Database Project was created in the Nook Cafe @ UH main Campus

The Program is made in the following languages 
PHP,HTML,CSS,Bootstrap,MySQL\
Hosted in Godaddy.com under the following domain name okaymunchy.com

We created a Database Based on searching for coffee shops and restaurants near our 
University in Downtown Houston in which students can sit down and study since we always nead a change of scenery

We integrated the following resources and methods to make the Site work

We used a dynamic Search engine or SearchBar that dynamically querys the database table 
The Google Maps API was used in the Creation and population of the maps and pins using gps coordinates 
and dysplayed the table using PHP and HTML code.

We used Pygeon software to create the web pages and templates

The Backend admin side was taken from online resources which some where modified to meet the following specifications 
Admin can add and delete users and update their username or password

The Database can Delete,Update and Insert entrys and should be able to dysplay hyperlinked foreign keys to display 
seperate tables based on their relation

A statistical page will be added see the database details dynamically since the database changes 

I thank


Daniel Torres for his help in adding newer ideas to the database.
Carlos Moreno for being the backend developer assistant helping me track bugs

Enjoy using my templates and cheers
